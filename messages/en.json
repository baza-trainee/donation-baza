Usually, the company either supports the team this way, or colleagues pool their money to relax together. The leftover amount, rounded up to 100-200 UAH, transferred to the military or a cat shelter, provides essential support. If 50 companies do this every week, the collection will be completed, and the event will gain additional meaning.",
