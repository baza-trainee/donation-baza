Simply collect the funds in a special box or transfer them to our account. Try practicing this with your whole team or department. Don’t forget to report the results once a month, and you'll be amazed at how significant your help can be. The larger the company, the more vulnerable the object of support. Choose an animal shelter or a small local project to support and feel their gratitude.",
